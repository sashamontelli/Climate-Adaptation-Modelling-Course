## GEOG00XX Climate Adaptation Modelling

Department of Geography, University College London: Proposed Paper

Course tutor: Dr. Aleksandr Montelli

Contributors: TBD
     
     
### Overview:
According to the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report, by 2100 sea levels could rise by 0.26 to 0.55 metres under a low-emission scenario and 0.45 to 0.82 metres under a high-emission scenario. The uncertainty in ice-sheet projections dominates trajectories of future global sea level for the second half of this century and beyond. Climate Adaptation Modelling will cater to 3rd year Geography and MSc students interested in gaining holistic understanding of how uncertainties in emission scenarios and associated cryospheric change affect mitigation and adaptation strategies, focussing of low-lying, densely populated coastal areas.
## 

### Aims:
This heavily project-centred course aims to develop overarching, futures-focused, meaningful links between multiple subjects within Human and Physical Geography. It will provide a hands-on training in: (1) finding, downloading, manipulating and subsequently deciphering different types of ice-sheet and climate model outputs; (2) translating and integrating model outputs into geospatial analysis; (3) choosing efficient data visualisation approaches; (4) developing informed sea level adaptation strategies and (5) public speaking, presenting and communicating science effectively.
